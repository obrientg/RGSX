## 🎮 Usage

### First Launch

- Auto-downloads system images and game lists
- Auto-configures controls if your controller is recognized
- **Controls broken?** Delete `/saves/ports/rgsx/controls.json` and restart

**Retrobat / first Windows launch**

- It is recommended to launch `RGSX Retrobat.bat` manually once, outside the Retrobat interface, to verify that everything is working.
- Allow Windows firewall prompts when they appear, especially for qBittorrent on first launch.
- Retrobat hides some system windows by default, so a first manual launch helps avoid missing an important prompt.
- The launcher then configures a local rule for the embedded qBittorrent binary and for the TCP `18572` WebUI.

**Keyboard Mode**: When no controller is detected, controls display as `[Key]` instead of icons.

### Pause Menu Structure

**Root categories**
- Games (downloads, scans, platform visibility)
- Language (switch UI language)
- Controls (help and remap)
- Display (layout, fonts, monitor/mode, visual options)
- Settings (music, symlink, auto extract, network and API status)
- Support (generate support ZIP/log bundle)
- Quit (exit or restart)

**Controls**
- View Controls Help (shows current mapped actions)
- Remap Controls (reconfigure keyboard/controller mapping)

**Display**
- Layout (3×3, 3×4, 4×3, 4×4)
- Font Size submenu (general UI + footer text)
- Font Family (Pixel or DejaVu)
- Monitor selection (when multiple monitors are detected)
- Screen Mode (Windows only)
- Light Mode (performance-friendly rendering)
- Hide Unknown Extension Warning (toggle unsupported extension warnings)

**Games**
- Update Game Cache (redownload systems/games data)
- Scan Owned ROMs (add locally owned ROMs to history)
- Download History (view/manage download entries)
- Show Unsupported Platforms (toggle platforms without local ROM folders)
- Filter Platforms (source/platform visibility menu)

**Settings**
- Background Music Toggle (enable/disable music)
- Symlink Options (choose copy/symlink behavior)
- Auto Extract Toggle (automatic archive extraction)
- ROMs Folder Selector (set custom ROM root folder)
- Web Service (Batocera/Knulli) (start web UI at boot)
- Custom DNS (Batocera/Knulli) (workaround for ISP/domain blocking)
- API Keys Status (check provider key presence)
- Connection Status (test required updates/sources sites)

## Embedded qBittorrent torrent backend

Torrent downloads now run through an embedded qBittorrent binary on both Windows and Linux/Batocera.

- LAN debug WebUI: `http://YOUR_DEVICE_IP:18572`
- Default credentials: `admin` / `RGSXqbt`
- The RGSX web interface now includes a `qBittorrent` button that opens this WebUI directly.

Useful notes:
- This WebUI is intended for debugging and advanced torrent monitoring from a phone or another PC on the same local network.
- If LAN access to the WebUI does not work, first check the local Windows firewall.
- Do not expose port `18572` directly to the Internet: it is the WebUI admin port, not the BitTorrent performance port.
- If torrent connectivity is poor, prefer UPnP or forwarding the actual BitTorrent listening port configured inside qBittorrent.

## 🌐 Web Interface (Batocera/Knulli Only)

RGSX includes a web interface that launched automatically when using RGSX for remote browsing and downloading games from any device on your network.

### Accessing the Web Interface

1. **Find your Batocera IP address**:
   - Check Batocera menu: `Network Settings`
   - Or from terminal: `ip addr show`

2. **Open in browser**: `http://[BATOCERA_IP]:5000` or `http://BATOCERA:5000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5000`

3. **Available from any device**: Phone, tablet, PC on the same network

### Web Interface Features

- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly** – Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- 🔍 **Browse All Systems** – View all platforms and games
- ⬇️ **Remote Downloads** – Queue downloads directly to your Batocera
- 📊 **Real-Time Status** – See active downloads and history
- 🎮 **Same Game Lists** – Uses identical sources as the main app


### Enable/Disable Web Service at Boot, without the need to launch RGSX

**From RGSX Menu**
1. Open **Pause Menu** (Start/ALTGr)
2. Navigate to **Settings > Web Service**
3. Toggle **Enable at Boot**
4. Restart your device


**Port Configuration**: The web service runs on port `5000` by default. Ensure this port is not blocked by firewall rules.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Controls not working | Delete `/saves/ports/rgsx/controls.json` + restart app, you can try delete /roms/ports/RGSX/assets/controls/xx.json too |
| No games ? | Pause Menu > Games > Update Game Cache, then check Pause Menu > Games > Filter Platforms and Show Unsupported Platforms. Check in rgsx_settings.json in `/saves/ports/rgsx/` if the value of `sources :  mode` is  `rgsx` and not `custom` |
| Missing systems on the list? | RGSX read es_systems.cfg to show only supported systems, if you want all systems : Pause Menu > Games > Show unsupported systems |
| App crashes | Check `/roms/ports/RGSX/logs/RGSX.log` or `/roms/windows/logs/Retrobat_RGSX_log.txt` |
| Layout change not applied | Restart RGSX after changing layout |
| Problem downloading some Games ? | Open Pause Menu > Settings > Connection Status. If one or more required sites are red, enable Custom DNS in Settings and reboot. Also check ISP/router protections (especially ASUS web threat blocking). |
| Have internet access {Pause Menu > Settings > Connection Status) but RGSX is not responding/working as intended? | Option #1: go to rgsx menu and use the reset settings buttons. Option #2: Confirm "source" setting is 'RGSX" in your C:\RetroBat\saves\ports\rgsx\rgsx_settings.json file. Be sure to use notepad or notepad++ (do not use Wordpad). Check the source line, it likely will be 'custom' which needs to be updated as "RGSX" instead.  |
